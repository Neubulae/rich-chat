If you need a refresher, use the command /formatting to get formatting help 

The mod supports links with titles `[Link title](link URL)`, and also autolinks any plain link pasted in. 

It also supports colours. If you're familiar with vanilla color codes, you can use those. The character used is &. You have to add a space though after the code. (e.g. &c this is red)
<br>
Color names also work. You can find these with /colors (some can be shortened)

You can mention players with an @ symbol.

Emoji codes! This mod supports emojis. You can see the emojis that are on the server by typing /emojis. Type them like you would on Discord like \:smile\:
